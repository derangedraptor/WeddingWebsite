            <p> Cammy and James still remember the first time they met and locked eyes. It was September of 2016 and one of the first Fridays of their first semester of undergraduate degree. They were both taking an Eastern studies history course that Cammy thought would be an easy A and James thought would be interesting. The class itself was a general education course that had at least seventy or so students but the two of them had been placed into the same discussion section of less than 15 students. Cammy arrived early and had already been seated when James walked in the room. The two of them immediately locked eyes. Cammy, who had been working retail over the summer, reflexively smiled due to her customer service training. James took this as an invite and sat down in the open seat next to her. From the first look Cammy thought James looked cute, but his leather computer shoulder bag and converse was a little geeky (in a cute way). James thought she looked cute and friendly because she smiled at him. James, being true to his forgetful nature, had forgotten his pencil and so he leaned over and asked Cammy if she had an extra. Cammy, who was always well prepared, had a spare. That was the start of the relationship, but now, after nearly nine years of dating, the adoption of three animals,  completion of three degrees, the two prepare for marriage and the true beginning of their adventures together.   </p>
